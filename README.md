# 🎯 Clear The Points - React Game Challenge

This is a simple interactive game built using **React**, **TypeScript**, and **TailwindCSS** as part of the **HAIBAZO Frontend Entrance Test**.

The game challenges the player to clear all points (circles) from the board by clicking them one by one. Each point disappears when clicked, and the game tracks how many have been cleared. Once all points are gone, a success message appears!
